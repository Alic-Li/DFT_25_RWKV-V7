### The DFT_25 project RWKV model update to RWKV_V7 For Power Energy Series Forecasting

```
git clone https://github.com/SJTU-Quant/qlib.git
cd qlib
pip install rwkv-fla
pip install .
```

Since the dataset is too large, we uploaded a test sub-dataset and a model parameter. 
You can directly run `python test_model_DFT.py` to get the test results.
